/**
 * You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:
 * Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
 * Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
 * Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
 * To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
